I am a sophomore Computer Science student at UNCG. I have been interested in the ins and outs of software and computing
since 3rd grade, and my course concentration in High School was in Digital Media. I have three siblings, two of whom are
in high school, while my sister is currently in Kindergarten. My ideal career path is a Professor in Computer Science,
after receiving either a Master's or Doctorate in Computer Science.
